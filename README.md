## Background

This is an iOS app. It's [available](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/24-math-game/id6747409323) in App Store worldwide. This repo is its code.

I built it because I couldn't find a good one in the App Store: simple, clean, and did exactly what it needed to do without any unnecessary bells and whistles. There used to be one that I enjoyed a few years, but it's gone since last year. So I decided to build one.

This is my very first iOS app. I had zero experience with mobile development. I am a backend guy for more than two decades. The entire app was built using Cursor. All code in this repo were generated by Cursor (note: this is my first time using Cursor), except some manual adjustments of difficulty rating in [HandDataset.swift](twentyfour/Game/HandDataset.swift). 

## Game Overview

The "24" game is an arithmetic puzzle where players are dealt 4 cards and must use each number exactly once to make 24 through basic arithmetic operations. The rules are simple:

- Use each number exactly once
- Use only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses
- The final result must equal 24

For example, if you're dealt `7`, `2`, `4`, `1`, one solution would be `(7 - 2 + 1) × 4 = 24`.

Face cards have the following values:
- Ace = 1
- Jack = 11
- Queen = 12
- King = 13

With a standard 52-card deck, there are 1820 four-card combinations, among which 1362 combinations have solution(s) and the other 458 combinations are unsolvable. 

For more details about the game and its history, check out the [24 Game on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(puzzle)).
