24 is an arithmetic puzzle where:

• You are dealt 4 cards
• Use these 4 numbers exactly once each
• Through addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses, make the result equal 24

## Card Values:
• A represents 1
• J, Q, K represent 11, 12, 13 respectively

• Parentheses ( )

## Not Allowed:

• Factorials
• Other advanced operations

## Examples:
• 7, 2, 4, 1 → (7-2) × 4 × 1 = 24
• 4, 7, 8, 8 → (7-(8÷8)) × 4 = 24
• 3, 3, 8, 8 → (8÷8 + 3) × 8 = 24

Difficulty levels range from Easy to Hardest, indicated by the number of stars.

## Tips:
• Each number must be used exactly once
• Parentheses can be used to change operation order
• Decimal numbers are allowed in intermediate steps, but the final result must be 24

## Important Note:
In this game, we ensure that every hand dealt has at least one solution. While some combinations of four numbers cannot make 24, these combinations will not appear in the game.
